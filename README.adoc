= External Artifacts

This link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries[Pipeline Shared Library]
performs an
link:http://unethicalblogger.com/2017/08/03/overriding-builtin-steps-pipeline.html[override]
of the built-in `archive` and `archiveArtifacts` steps to provide external
artifact storage.


== Configuring

The main entrypoint for this library is to load it as a Global Pipeline
Library:

=== Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in
link:http://localhost:8080/configure[JENKINS_HOME/configure]:

* `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`
* `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME`

=== Credentials

A "Secret Text" credential should be defined with the ID `azure-access-key`,
and contain an Azure Storage Account "Access Key."

== Notes for the future

=== Artifact Pointer

It might make sense to implement an artifact pointer (via a plugin extending
link:https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/jenkins-core/#artifactmanagerfactory[this extension point])
which avoids the need for an HTTP redirect.

An artifact pointer could be described as a JSON file, e.g.:

.timestamps.txt.jartptr
[source,json]
=====
{
    "fingerprint" : "<md5sum of original file>",
    "uri" : "https://some/external/uri",
    "name" : "timestamps.txt",
    "attributes" : {
        "bytes" : 309,
        "ctime" : "2018-01-04 17:00:00Z"
    }
}
====

Jenkins could then identify this file as such, and link a `timestamps.txt` in
the web UI directly to the `uri` attribute defined in the `.jartptr` manifest.
